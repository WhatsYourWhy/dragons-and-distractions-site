# 📜 Codex (Coming Online)

This is the living philosophy and tone guide for Dragons & Distractions. Upcoming scrolls will cover:

- Voice and tone guardrails so the mythic language stays consistent.
- Origin story and design principles for monsters, spells, and rituals.
- Submission guidelines for new creatures, tools, and community additions.

While the full codex is being transcribed, you can still explore the creatures and rituals already forged.
