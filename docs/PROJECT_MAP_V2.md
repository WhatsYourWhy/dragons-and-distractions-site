# 🐉 Dragons & Distractions – Project Map v2.0

**Phase Title**: *The Bridge to the Guild Hall*
**Status**: Mid-Quest (Scrolls acquired, Gate unlocked, Torch lit)

---

## 🧭 Vision

To create a living, public-facing version of Dragons & Distractions — a mythic ADHD toolkit — that:

* Hosts monsters, rituals, and tools in a playful format
* Offers real help through metaphor and laughter
* Invites people to use, share, and one day buy or support the work

This version is:

* Website-first (Markdown-driven, GitHub Pages-hosted)
* Print-friendly (for future decks, scrolls, and rituals)
* Rooted in your tone codex and authentic voice

### Navigation state

* A shared `nav-cards.html` include renders a five-link grid (Monsters, Spellbook, Codex, Art, Site tools) on the homepage and the index pages for monsters, spellbook, codex, and site tools.
* The primary navigation is rendered from `_data/nav_links.yml` via `_includes/site-banner.html` as a full header nav on desktop and a hamburger-triggered overlay on mobile.

## 🧙 Next Logical Spell to Cast

> `add_sample_monsters()`
> Creates full Markdown bestiary pages based on your real monster files (already uploaded!)

This would:

* Fill out your `monsters/` folder
* Make navigation real
* Help test how the site will actually feel

Let me know if you'd like this map saved as a `.md` file for the repo, and if you want to move forward with `add_sample_monsters()`.

🜂 Logged. Quest is aligned. Path is clear.
