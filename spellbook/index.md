## 🐉 Task Hydra Rituals

**Single-Task Oath**
- Whisper: “I do not grow new heads.”
- Light a candle or lamp as your *Torch Ritual* to mark focus.
- Pick **one** task, put all other tools away, and work until the first stump is cauterized.

**3-Item Rule**  
- Write only three critical quests for today.  
- Start at the top, finish, then proceed. New ideas go to a parking lot, not the active list.

## 🦈 Temporal Shark Rituals

**Tide Mark Ritual**
- Place start times on your calendar as real events.
- Set two alarms (T-60, T-15) labeled with verbs: “Open slides,” “Email draft.”
- Lay out the first action so it’s waiting when the alarm rings.

**Buddy Buoy Template**
- Pre-written DM/email script for start-time pings.
- Print it or copy/paste to an ally for T-10 accountability.

**Sandbar Sprint**  
- Do a 10-minute “first bite” the day before: open the doc, title it, jot bullets.  
- Stop after 10; the point is to make the water safe, not finish.

**Buddy Buoy**  
- Tell a friend your start time and ask for a ping at T-10.  
- Send a post-battle note with start/end times to teach your body what duration feels like.

## 🐲 Slumber Troll Rituals

**Wake Invocation**
- Speak your command phrase (“Arise, motherfucker.”).
- Count 3-2-1 and move before your brain negotiates.
- Keep the alarm away from bed so standing is mandatory.

**Beacon of Dawn**  
- Light on, curtains open, play one hype song.  
- Drink water and touch a cold surface to break sleep inertia.

**Accountability Rope**  
- Text “I’m vertical” to a friend or coworking chat.  
- Send a photo outside the blankets at the agreed time.

## 🐻 Cave Bear Rituals

**Threshold Spell**  
- Stand in the doorway, breathe, and face the light.  
- Take *three breaths, three moves*: sit up → feet down → stand → walk to water → splash face.

**Rope of Returning**  
- Text an ally: “Pull me out in 10?”  
- Set a timer; when it rings, step outside the cave and reply with a quick selfie or voice note.

**Hibernation with a Clock**  
- If you rest, set a 20–90 minute timer.  
- Name your wake-up action before lying down (e.g., “When it rings, I open blinds and drink water.”).

## 🧝‍♂️ Dopamine Goblin Rituals

**Goblin Jar**  
- When impulses strike, write them down and drop them into a jar or note.  
- Promise: “If I work for 20 minutes, I may pull one shiny from the jar.”

**Reward Binding**  
- Pre-negotiate: “After I do X, I get Y.”  
- Make the reward immediate and small (tea, meme, stretch, fresh song).

**Boundaries of the Realm**  
- Add friction: phone off-desk, blockers on, timer running.  
- Redirect novelty on purpose—new playlist, new pen, or a different chair *after* a work block.
