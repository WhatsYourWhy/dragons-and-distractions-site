# ⚔️ Armory & Spellbook

Welcome to the working shelf of rituals, tools, and templates. This space will gather the counter-spells mentioned in each monster page so you can grab a ritual without rereading the whole bestiary.

## 🧪 What lives here

- Quick-start rituals from the monsters (single-task oath, 3-item rule, tide marks, wake rituals)
- Printable prompts and checklists as they are forged
- Links to any physical artifacts or templates shared in the `site/` folder

New spells will be added as the toolkit grows. For now, use this as a staging area and add your own house rules.
