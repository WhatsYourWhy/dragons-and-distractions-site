## ✍️ Oath Text (copy or print)

> **Single-Task Oath**  
> I choose one head. I do not grow new ones.  
> Today’s three quests: ____, ____, ____.

- Optional mantra: “One torch, one tunnel.”
- Sign and date if you like ritual weight.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Before starting work, fill the three blank quests for the day.  
2. Place the card where you can see it; light your *Torch Ritual* or lamp to mark focus.  
3. When a new idea appears, park it on a separate page instead of your oath.  
4. Cross off each quest as you cauterize it; if unfinished, migrate no more than one item to tomorrow.

## 🧾 Printable Prompt (minimal)
