## 🔥 What is This?

This isn’t therapy. But it’s therapeutic.  
It’s not a game. But it’s fun.  
It’s not a joke. But it’s funny.

Here, you’ll find:

- Mythic metaphors for real ADHD challenges
- Rituals disguised as spells
- Tools reframed as enchanted artifacts
- A Monster Manual for mortals trying to get sh*t done

> Name your monster. Equip your gear. Cast your first spell.
